**RSS**

On this link `http://localhost/pkm/sync/rssPile`, you can find a RSS feed of the bookmarked records in Nibras. You can past it in your favorite RSS reader e.g. [RSSOwl](www.rssowl.org), or its fork RSSOwlNix.

Note:
- The *author* field of the RSS feed time is used for *module type*. So if you want to group the items by their module, choose "*Grouped by Author*" from the feed toolbar (as is the case in the screenshot).
