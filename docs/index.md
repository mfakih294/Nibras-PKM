## Rational

In the age of the internet, personal information has become fragmented across devices, cloud applications, sites, social media, desktop applications, and personal storage, in addition to those on paper (notebooks, documents..), and governed by various applications, each has its own methods to organize the information.

This situation is problematic, as the person has a hard time organizing all this information in a unified way, and in a centralized way. He/she may forget or lose information, take a long time to find them, or simply get distracted by the sheer amount of information coming to his space.

Believing in the following core values makes the situation even more problematic:
- Information is meant to be transformed into knowledge, and not for mere entertainment.
- Knowledge must be applied, and can't be gained fully except by applying it.

Principles:
- Transforming information into knowledge is a slow, paintful, and long process.
- Applying the knowledge is also slow, paintful, and long process.

As a result, acquiring vast amounts of (new) information in a fast way is not aligned with the above values and principles.

Solution:

- Centralized management of the personal information.

Two main options for the storage place:
- on the cloud
- on the personal computer.
- on the (smart) mobile phone


The cloud:
- Technical setup, maintenance, security and administration are their responsbility
- Usually costs money (eventually it will often cost money)
- Requires constant fast connection
- Service features may change
- Hard to use other applications to manage the data
- Account may be termination
- Service may be terminated

The personal computer:
- Cheap and large storage 
- High and cheap processing power
- Can run complex applications
- Wide administration control
- Responsibility to setup, administrator, repair, backup, secure
- Hard to have synchronized data on other devices
- Hard to move it


The mobile
- Highly portable
- Passive consumer of information
- Applications are simple in design and scope
- Limited storage and processing power
- Very limited administration options

Options for the application governing the information:
- The operating system itself (Windows).
- A closed-source application.
- An open source application.

A closed-source application:
- May be rich in features and good company support
- May be expensive
- Hard to customize and tailor to your needs
- May get abondened by the company
- Usually easy-to-use


An open-source application:
- Totally free
- Ability to modify it (you can own its code)
- May be hard to use
- May be in the stage of active development



**Nibras PKM** is a __local open source__ system for the __long-term management__ of __personal__ information. It is a combination of a __web-based__ application intended for desktop use and where all the records are entered, and an Android __reader and note taker__ application.

**Local**

The user has full control over his/her data, without the need for a (fast) internet connection, and without all the distractions and information overload that the internet can cause.

**Open source**

The user has control over the system itself too, especially when using it on the long term to manage the important personal information and files.

**Comprehensize**

It manages resources (articles, books, documents), notes, writings, tasks, goals, journal, planner, payments, indicators, and (study) courses and departments.

**Powerful**

It was designed with large amounts of information in mind. In current usage, it manages dozens of thousands of records. With its commands and saved searches, it makes easy to navigate through all the information.
