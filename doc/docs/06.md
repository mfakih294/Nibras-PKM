# Search

There are 3 types of searches in Nibras: quick search (top right search box), forms, and commands.

<!-- Pomegranate gives the user 4 options to query or search the records:

What is HQL query. 
Visit the gallery of saved searches on this link.


Most databases in use today are relational. The standard language to query them is SQL. When tables are mapped to class objects in certain frameworks as in Grails, you can use a language that is more powerful than SQL. You can write shorter code in it, over SQL.


'''Nibras command''': available from the command bar, it uses Nibras syntax and it is internally translated to HQL query. It is a shorthand notation used for fast queries. The translated HQL query is shown on the screen and can then be stored permanently as saved search. Example 'f t p3 ?pending #bug', will find all tasks that are of priority 3, of status 'pending' and type 'bug'. More about this syntax in a later section.
'''Full text search''': backed by Lucene library, it gives full text seach of the text fields of the main information types. It is available from the command line and can be stored as saved search. Lucene syntax is presented on ?. Example 's b information overload' to search all resources (books, articles etc) about the occurrance of the terms information overload

'''Direct HQL query''': available from the command bar and can be stored as saved search. Example 'q from Task where priority # 3'

'''Ad hoc query''': Similar to direct HQL query but here the user specific what fields he/she wants to be. The results are display in table instead of the long card representation of direct HQL query. Example 'h select id, summary, status from Task', to display a table with 3 columns id, summary and status of all tasks. Ad hoc query can be stored as saved search.

## Forms
Form-based search: available on left-hand side of the screen, gives the user the most straightforward way to query the main information types (all except the parameters).

## Saved searches

Saved searches are one of the main features of Nibras system. They are used to build most of the navigation menu and reports.

For example, you can use saved query to:

* Get a list of results e.g. all high priority tasks.
* Get a table where columns maps to record fields e.g. get all dates and summary of journal records of type 'external event'.
* Get a random record or records from the list.
* Display the results in a table grouped by a certain field e.g. course.
* Display the results in a calendar or timeline.

**Saved search record**
A saved search contains a query and a title, with optionally the query to count the total number.
