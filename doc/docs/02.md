## Calendar page

The calendar page shows the journal and planner records, as well as the notes and resouces read withtin a specific time frame. 

It is available from the "Calendar" link in the north region of the application.



** A sample month view of the calendar**

** A sample week view of the calendar**
![calendar-panel](./images/calendar-week.jpg)



The user can add an event to the calendar after selecting a region in the week or day view of the calendar. The text entered can be a free text, in which case a journal record is created with the text as its title, or can be a Nibras command to add more metadata for the record. The command can start with **j** or **p** to create a journal or planner record, respectively.

## Record display
The record in Nibras can be displayed in full and short form. The full form is the default.

![full-box](./images/full-box.jpg)


**Example** of a full form of a resource (book) record, and under it are the actions buttons. They are displayed when the cursor is over the form.

**Short form** is used in places like tables, to reduce the space occupied by the records.

**Esc** (escape): moves focus (cursor) and cursor to the quick search field.

**F7**: moves focus (cursor) and cursor to the bottom main command line.

**Ctrl + arrows**: hides/shows the panel corresponding to the arrow:
* **left arrow**: west region.
